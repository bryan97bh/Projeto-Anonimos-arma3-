<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> You can salvage destroyed vehicles or sell good ones at the vehicle-dealer ( marked with Sell Vehicle on map )
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Rearm, refuel and repair your vehicles at the trucks marked on the map with Resupply.
<br/>

<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Save and transfer money at the ATMs ( marked yellow on the map ).
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Your gear and money will be saved over the server-restarts automatically.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> You need to lock weapon crates and Base-elements every 120 hours if you want to save them ( scroll mouse when standing in front )
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> The Base Locker allows you to prevent your base objects from unlocking.
