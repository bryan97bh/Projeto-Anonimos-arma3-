<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Experienced users should play Independent. You can play as a Lonewolf or group up with friends. A max of 15 players per group is allowed.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Earny money, gear and vehicles by doing missions ( red crosses marked on map ) or buy your stuff at the marked stores.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> You can salvage destroyed vehicles or sell good ones at the vehicle-dealer ( marked with Sell Vehicle on map )
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Rearm, refuel and repair your vehicles at the trucks marked on the map with Resupply.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> The blue circles at the towns are the Spawn-Areas. You can find vehicles with standart loot in it. 
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Save and transfer money at the ATMs ( marked yellow on the map ).
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Your gear and money will be saved over the server-restarts automatically.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> You need to lock weapon crates and Base-elements every 120 hours if you want to save them ( scroll mouse when standing in front )
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> The Base Locker allows you to prevent your base objects from unlocking. 
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Bought and mission vehicles can be locked by default. A CodeLock can be found at the General Store. 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Scroll mouse to request Air-support if you´re left in the middle of nowhere.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Press End-key for earplugs, Windows-key to see friendly player-names.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> First Aid-Kit is for stabilizing, Medi-Kit is for reviving your Team-members.
<br/>
<br/><font face='PuristaBold'>*</font> Get a second chance by placing a Spawn-Beacon. Buy it at General Store. You can spawn there once every 15 minutes.
